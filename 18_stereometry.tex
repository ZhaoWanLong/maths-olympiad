Points $P_1,\dots,P_n$ are in space such that no three are collinear. Any triangle $P_iP_jP_k$ contains a side which is shorter than $a$. Prove that there exist spheres $S_1$ and $S_2$ with radii, such that all of the $n$ points are in at least one of them.

$P_1$ is a convex polyhedron with vertices $A_1, A_2,\dots,A_9$. Polyhedra $P_2,\dots,P_9$ are formed by shifting $P_1$ such that $A_1$ is shifted to $A_2,\dots,A_9$ respectively. Prove that at least two of the polyhedra $P_1,\dots,P_9$ are intersecting.

Find all integers $n$ for which there exists a convex polyhedron and which satisfies all the following:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item All faces of the polyhedron are regular polygons
  \item Among the faces of the polyhedron there are at most two polygons with different number of sides
  \item There exist two faces which share an edge and are both $n$-gons.
\end{enumerate}

A convex polyhedron has faces $S_1,\dots,S_n$ with areas $A_1,\dots,A_n$ respectively. For each side $S_i$, let us define a vector $\vec{v_i}$ with length $A_i$ and normal to $S_1$. Prove that $\sum_{i=1}^n \vec{v_i} = \vec{0}$


\end{enumerate}
